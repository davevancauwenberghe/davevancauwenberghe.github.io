## ✍️ Style Guidelines

- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces is fine — just match)
- Use `textContent` over `innerHTML` to prevent XSS
- Keep multiline strings in template literals (`` `...` ``)
- Use `const` / `let`, no `var`
- Keep folder/file names lowercase and dash-separated

## 🧠 Things to keep in mind

- Terminal output should look like a classic console
- Folders should be navigable via `cd`, `ls`, and `open`
- Sounds must be small and royalty-free (use MP3)
- CodeQL will scan all PRs — make sure your JS is clean
